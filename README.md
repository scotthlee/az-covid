# Building better case definitions for COVID-19
This repo holds the code used to generate the results in our paper "Performance of Existing and Novel Symptom- and Antigen Testing-Based COVID-19 Case Definitions in a Community Setting". For more info about the study, read the preprint on medrXiv [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.10.22274914). For more info about the Python scripts, read on.

## Code
Running the following scripts in order will produce all of the that appeared in our paper (though not necessarily with the same formatting, some of which was done by hand), including the case definitions, performance metrics, confidence intervals, and visualizations. 

1. `preprocessing.py` creates the analytic dataset from the raw data.
2. `combos.py` runs the combinatorial optimization and makes a new version of the analytic dataset that includes our novel case definitions.
3. `rf.py` runs the random forest part of our analysis.
4. `inference.py` constructs confidence intervals for our main metrics.
5. `viz.py` makes the figures in the paper.

The other two scripts, `tools.py` and `multi.py` contain the support functions needed to run the other scripts. For the linear-program-based combinatorial optimzation, we use the `case-def-optimization` package, which we included with this repository as a submodule.

## Software
All code was written in Python 3, and the specific dependcies are listed in the [requirements](requirements.txt.) file. The dependencies can be installed one-by-one or by running e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Where possible, we used the `multiprocessing` module to speed things up.

## Hardware
We ran all our analyses on a Dell scientific workstation with 24 logical cores and 64GB of RAM. The scripts will run fine on smaller machines, but `combos.py` and `rf.py` make take a while to run.
